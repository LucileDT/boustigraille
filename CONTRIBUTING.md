# Opening issues

You can open new issues or comment existing ones as needed. It can be done:

- to ask a question (it will probably lead to a README or Wiki edition)
- to contribute to Boustigraille (e.G. by making mockups or illustrations)

Issues which aren't part of this list will probably be moved to a Discussion.
